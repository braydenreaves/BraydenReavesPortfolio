            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, My name is Brayden Reaves. I am from Mishawaka, Indiana and I graduated from Indiana University with
                a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Informatics and a Minor/Cognate in Business. I am a very motivated,
                ambitious technology and business graduate with a strong passion for innovation and problem-solving.
                Seeking a position within the field of technology to expand upon knowledge gained during academic
                studies and develop practical skills in a professional environment. Committed to continuous learning and
                growth to contribute effectively to an organization's success while expanding personal expertise.</p>
            <p>At Indiana University, I gained a lot of knowledge in the fields of both technology and business. I
                learned HTML, CSS, UI/UX Design, PHP, SQL, Javascript, Python, web design, front-end developement,
                wireframing and prototyping, basic financial management, basic operations management, basic marketing,
                and a small amount of back-end development.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong communicator and collaborator. I have experience
                working in teams and understand the importance of clear and effective communication in order to achieve
                project goals. Along with these skills comes the ability of problem solving, teamwork, and interpersonal
                communication. With these technical and soft skills I hope that I can bring a new light to the world.
            </p>
