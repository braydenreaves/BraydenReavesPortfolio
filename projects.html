            <p>B-Town Student Housing was a group project that was developed over the course of my final year at Indiana
                University. This website was developed for the purpose of making it easier for students to be able to
                find housing whether it be on or off-campus. Every student at Indiana University has had to look for
                housing in Bloomington at some point during their college career. Many of these students have struggled
                to find a convenient place to look for housing year to year. There are options such as Apartments.com or
                Zillow, but none of these integrate the housing options that Indiana University has to offer.
                Additionally, the current IU housing website is not as user-friendly as one would expect. Thus, our team
                wanted to solve all of these problems surrounding the housing search in Bloomington by developing B-Town
                Student Housing.</p>
            <p>This project consisted of 8 major features that were implemetented into the site. These features being:
                the ability to register and create a realtor or student profile through our site, the realtor profile
                that shows individual housing listings and the ability to edit and delete these individual listings, a
                contact page to allow students to contact realtors for listings, on/off campus listing pages and an all
                listing page, student profile page, preference searching for listings, a map that shows the locations of
                all posted listings, and a verification system for realtors to prove that they are legitimate. * NOTE:
                Demo page does not show all features. *</p>

        <h1>Brilliant Coffee Co. Redesign - Web Design Project</h1>

    <div class="btowncontainer">
        <div class="btowntextcontainer">
            <p>This was a CSS design based project where I was supposed to redesign a website for Brilliant Coffee Co.
                in Bloomington, IN. It was a fun project to show what I had learned from my web deisgn course over the
                year. This website was fully designed with HTML and CSS with a little bit of javascript.</p>
            <p>This site has access to both a homepage and a menu page. It shows where you can find Brilliant Coffee Co.
                in Bloomington, when and how long Brilliant Coffee Co. is open, and has all of Brilliant Coffee Co.'s
                social media linked to both pages.</p>
